## Sentiment Classifer in Python
This notebook builds and exports a serialized Twitter sentiment classifier using Python with scikit-learn. The classifier is based on the approach of [Go et al](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/papers/TwitterDistantSupervision09.pdf) using the [Sentiment140 data](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/). The data can be downloaded from the Sentiment140 website.

The classifier has an accuracy of 84% on the test dataset consisting of several hundred annotated tweets. The training set consists of > 1m tweets automatically generated by assuming that any tweet with positive emoticons, like :), were positive, and tweets with negative emoticons, like :(, were negative. This technique is called distant supervision using emoticons as noisy labels.
